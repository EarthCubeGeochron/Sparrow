A development version of **Sparrow** has been implemented in several labs. Large
portions of the analytical archive of each lab have been ingested, and work is
progressing on building metadata management functionality.

## Active installations

These instances are managed by laboratory workers.

- [Arizona LaserChron Center](http://sparrow.laserchron.org)
- [WiscAr](https://wiscar-sparrow.geoscience.wisc.edu)
- [WiscSIMS](https://wiscsims-data.geoscience.wisc.edu/)
- [Cosmogenic nuclides lab](https://sparrow-cosmo.geoscience.wisc.edu)
- [Desert Research Institute luminescence lab](https://sparrow.dri.edu)
- [Boise State Isotope Geology Laboratory](http://sparrow.boisestate.edu)

## Demo instances

These instances are run internally without direct management by laboratories.
