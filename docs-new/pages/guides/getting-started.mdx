Although Sparrow is a complex software application, it is packaged in
a set of [**Docker** containers](https://www.docker.com/), enabling relatively seamless cross-platform
installation, independent of the configuration of the base system.
Local installation is possible, but less supported.

:::note
Running Sparrow on Windows is somewhat more complex than for Unix (e.g. Linux, Mac)
systems. If you want to do this, please see the [**Sparrow on Windows**](/docs/sparrow-on-windows)
documentation.
:::

## Install Docker

Sparrow is a _containerized_ application.

In its containerized form, Sparrow can be installed easily
on any Unix environment. This containerized
distribution strategy will allow easy deployment on any infrastructure
(local, cloud hosting, AWS/Azure, etc.).
The Docker toolchain is stable and open-source.

The only installation requirements on Unix host
systems (e.g. Linux and MacOS) are `docker` and `python3`.
First, [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and
`docker-compose` using the instructions for your platform, and
make sure your user can run `docker` without root permissions (typically
`sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`).
Installation is also possible on Windows 10 using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

# Download Sparrow

:::tip New!
Sparrow is now available via a [bundled download](/docs/getting-started#bundled-version).
:::

Currently there are two ways to downloading Sparrow. Either
download a bundled version or clone the codebase directly from Github. The former, bundled version,
is the main way Sparrow should be downloaded. The bundled version has an easier download and startup process and removes
the need for the user to manage a core codebase. There is, however, still the ability to customize a Sparrow instance through
frontend and backend plugins.

The second way to download Sparrow is to clone the [Sparrow](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow) repository from Github.
This process is more involved, however it gives access to the core codebase.
**NOTE:** modifying the main codebase should only be done if the user intends to
contribute to Sparrow.

## Bundled Version

### Shell command

Downloading the bundled version of Sparrow occurs through a `curl` command. `curl` commands are used
to transfer data from servers.

```javascript
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/HEAD/get-sparrow.sh)"
```

This is the most updated `curl` command at this time. The most recent release can be found at [Sparrow's Github page](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow) in the right most column
under **Releases**. This command will download all the files to your `usr/local/bin` and `usr/local/opt` directories.
In your favorite terminal or shell, run the command from above. If it is installed properly you should
see the output _Sparrow executable installed!_

If the installation works, try running `sparrow` on in the same terminal or shell. If the Sparrow CLI has been downloaded correctly
you will see a list of possible [sparrow commands](/docs/command-line-interface). If you do **not** see a list of sparrow commands you may have to write `usr/local/bin` to your `PATH` variable.
Otherwise, you have successfully installed Sparrow!

You can immediately view the instance of sparrow by running.

```
SPARROW_SECRET_KEY=TemporaryKey sparrow up
```

Or you can continute onto to [creating a new user](/docs/getting-started#creating-a-user) and
[creating a sparrow configuration](/docs/getting-started#running-a-configured-application).

The quickest way to set up an instance of Sparrow is by running:

```
sparrow create-test-lab <directory name>
```

This will create an out of the box Sparrow instance that will come pre-configured with a Sparrow configuration file as well
as directories used for frontend and backend plugins. There is also some test data that is pre-loaded in the backend plugin.

## Cloning Sparrow Codebase

:::caution
Cloning Sparrow's codebase should only be done by those who wish to contribute to the core codebase.
If you want to set up a lab instance of Sparrow without modifying the core codebase please refer to
the [bundled version](/docs/getting-started#bundled-version).
:::

### Getting the code

Currently, all installations of Sparrow require you to fetch the source code
from GitHub. Work is progressing on a "standalone" version of Sparrow that does not require
interacting with the source code. But for now, only development installation
is supported.

```
git clone https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow.git
cd Sparrow
```

### Installing the command-line interface

**Sparrow** is administered using the `sparrow` command-line
interface. This command wraps application management, database management,
and container-orchestration subcommands (wrapping [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
in a single executable, simplifying basic management tasks.
Lab-specific subcommands (e.g. for import scripts) can be included in this
interface.

To install the command-line application, run the setup command within the
`Sparrow` repository directory (you will be asked for a password).

```
make install
```

This will build a development version of the
`sparrow` command-line runner.

:::note
`make install` requests **`sudo`** privilege elevation so that it can
install `sparrow` to `/usr/local/bin`, which allows the command to be
run without a path prefix on most systems. If you want to install to a different location, you can
instead run `SPARROW_INSTALL_DIR=<root-path> make install`. This will install `sparrow`
to `<root-path>/bin/sparrow`.
:::

### Running Sparrow

Typing `sparrow` at the command line will download and build containers
(this will take a long time on initial run)
and show the [application's help page](/docs/cli).
Seeing the help page successfully means the application has been installed.

The **Sparrow** application can be run using the command
`sparrow up`. The environment variable
`SPARROW_SECRET_KEY` must be set before running, but other variables
will be set to default values if not provided. Thus, a minimal working
**Sparrow** demo can be run using the following command:

```
SPARROW_SECRET_KEY=TemporaryKey sparrow up
```

This command will spin up a database engine, frontend, backend,
and gateway service (details of each service can be found in
`docker-compose.yaml`) and automatically run the `sparrow init`
command to set up database tables.
The **Sparrow** web interface can then be accessed at `http://localhost:5002`;
the API can be found at `http://localhost:5002/api`.

## Creating a user

On navigating to the web interface for the first time, you will not be logged
in â€” indeed, no user will exist! To create a user, run the `sparrow create-user` command and follow the prompts. There should be a single row in
the `user` table after running this command. Note: the `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable is used to encrypt passwords, so make sure
this value is kept consistent through the lifetime of the application.

## Running a configured application

**Sparrow** is configured using a shell script that exports environment
variables to customize the **Sparrow** installation. An example of this script
is shown in [`sparrow-config.sh.example`](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/blob/master/sparrow-config.sh.example).
While not _required_ (environment
variables can be set externally), this approach is strongly preferred.

At runtime, the `sparrow` application finds a configuration file by searching
upwards from the current directory until the first file named
`sparrow-config.sh` is found. Alternatively, the location of the configuration
file can be set using the `SPARROW_CONFIG` environment variable. This will
allow the `sparrow` command to be run from anywhere on the system.

The best way to get a basic configured application to test is by running the
`sparrow create-test-lab <your-directory>` command, which will give you a
basic lab with a few plugins and a small test dataset, based on the configuration
[in this directory](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/tree/master/test-lab).

Managing lab implementations of Sparrow as Git repositories is a good idea, as it
allows plugins and site content to be versioned and pinned (using [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule))
to a specific version of Sparrow. This has the added benefit of allowing configurations
and lab-specific code to be publicly available to guide future implementations. This approach
is taken by the [UW Cosmogenic Nuclide lab](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/sparrow-uw-cosmo),
[Arizona Laserchron Center](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-LaserChron),
[WiscAr](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-WiscAr),
[the Desert Research Institute](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-luminescence-demo),
and other implementing facilities.

## Inspecting the running application

Several `sparrow` subcommands allow inspection of the running
**Sparrow** application:

- `sparrow test` runs the application's testing suite.
- `sparrow psql` allows interaction with the **Sparrow** database
  using the standard `psql` management tool that ships with PostgreSQL.
- `sparrow db-tunnel` exposes the PostgreSQL database engine
  on `localhost` port `54321` (database `sparrow`, user `postgres`).
  This is useful for schema introspection and data management
  using GUI tools such as [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).
- `sparrow shell` runs an iPython shell within the application.
- `sparrow shell <container>` creates a command-line shell within a Docker
  container in the application.
- `sparrow config` prints the API server configuration.
- `sparrow compose config` prints the `docker-compose` configuration
  in use for running the containerized application.
