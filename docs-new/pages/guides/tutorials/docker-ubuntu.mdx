### Installation

Full installation documentation for Docker on Ubuntu can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository). There are several ways to install but below you will find instructions for what we believe to be the most straight forward.

First thing to do is update `apt-get` and then use `apt-get` to install docker:

```
 (sudo) apt-get update
 (sudo) apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

You may or may not need `sudo` based on how your permissions are configured. If you wish to install a specific version of docker you can do can the following commands to first list available versions and then the next to install the specific version.

```bash
apt-cache madison docker-ce
sudo apt-get install docker-ce=<VERSION_STRING> docker-ce-cli=<VERSION_STRING> containerd.io
```

At the end you can test if docker was installed correctly by running:

```bash
 sudo docker run hello-world
```

If you already have docker installed and want to update, update `apt-get` and repeat the installation instructions above.

### Uninstall Docker

You may want to uninstall docker completely for a variety of reasons. In rare cases, uninstalling docker and reinstalling it can solve unusual bugs. To remove docker on ubuntu run the following command:

```bash
 sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

NOTE: the above command will not remove any of the images or volumes created by docker and stored in `var` directories. To remove those you can run the following commands:

```bash
 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker
 sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd
```

### Issues:

You may have an older verison of docker installed that has a different name, \(`docker`, `docker.io`, or `docker-engine` \). This might be causing conflicts and they should be removed via the following command:

```bash
 sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```
