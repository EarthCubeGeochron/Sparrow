# Create a Lab Instance

Once you have the command line running as show in [Getting started](/docs/getting-started), the next thing
to do is to create a project folder for your instance of sparrow. Your project folder will house all your
sparrow plugin code, both frontend and backend. It will also house your configuration file `sparrow-config.sh`
that needs to contain environmental variables specific to your lab instance.

The quickest way to do this is to run `sparrow create-test-lab`. This built in command line function will
auto-generate the correct folder and file structure needed. It should generate a folder and file tree
similar to the following.

```bash
|__project-directory
| | __backend-plugins
| | | ____init.py__
| | __frontend-plugins
| | | __index.js
| | | __landing-text.md
| | __site-content
| | | __index.js
| | __sparrow-config.sh
```

This is the perfect base to begin making your own customizations to your lab instance. Begin by editing
some of the default content in the autogenerated files.

### Summary:

- `sparrow create-test-lab`: autogenerates the file hierarchy for a project directory.

export default DocsPage;
