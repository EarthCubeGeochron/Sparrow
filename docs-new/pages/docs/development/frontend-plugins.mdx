Frontend Plugins

import { DocsPage } from "components";

Frontend plugins are written in JavaScript and take advantage of extensive open-source libraries for data transformation and visualization.

### Visualizations

Data visualization is a powerful way to quickly check the structure and quality of data imported into your Sparrow instance. Some visualizations are built-in to Sparrow \(e.g. [maps of samples](https://wiscar-sparrow.geoscience.wisc.edu/map)\), but your lab may benefit from additional visualizations. To build a simple visualization such as a crossplot, you need to determine what data you need, retrieve the data, and build the plot.

Retrieving data...

An example crossplot figure using the [VX library](https://vx-demo.vercel.app/) is detailed below. This is based on a crossplot for the WiscSIMS lab and you can [see the code here on Github](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/blob/main/frontend/plugins/dtfa-plot/index.tsx).

#### Importing functions

To make a figure...

```typescript
import h from "react-hyperscript";
import React from "react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";
import { Group } from "@vx/group";
import { scaleTime, scaleLinear } from "@vx/scale";
import { AreaClosed } from "@vx/shape";
import { LinePath } from "@vx/shape";
import { AxisLeft, AxisBottom } from "@vx/axis";
import { LinearGradient } from "@vx/gradient";
import { extent, max } from "d3-array";
import { curveMonotoneX } from "@vx/curve";
import { Point } from "@vx/point";
import { MarkerCircle } from "@vx/marker";
import { useAPIResult } from "@macrostrat/ui-components";
import { Card, Spinner } from "@blueprintjs/core";
import ReactJSON from "react-json-view";
```

export default DocsPage;
