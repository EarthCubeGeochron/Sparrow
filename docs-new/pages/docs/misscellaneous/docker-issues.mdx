Docker gotchas

import { DocsPage } from "components";

Docker is a complex system for managing containers. There are several gotchas you might encounter:

If you run into errors such as "no space left on device", the likely cause is that Docker has run out of space to organize its images. This can be solved using `docker system prune` which will remove all unused containers and images while ignoring docker volumes \(database\).

export default DocsPage;
