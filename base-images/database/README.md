# Sparrow database base image

In Sparrow versions 1-3, off-the-shelf PostgreSQL database images
were used to power the Sparrow database. In Sparrow 4, we build our
own image. The main reason to do this is that we want to load several
extensions directly onto the database image. Key extensions:

- [pgMemento](https://github.com/pgMemento/pgMemento)
- [SafeUpdate](https://github.com/eradman/pg-safeupdate): This is useful for connecting
  autogenerated APIs to PostgREST (see [the docs](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/integrations/pg-safeupdate.html))
