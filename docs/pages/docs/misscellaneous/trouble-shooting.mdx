## Trouble Shooting Sparrow

Can't get sparrow running? No need to worry, this page is for you. First, check a few things about your environment.

- Make sure Docker and Docker Dameon is installed.
  - If using a windows computer, make sure WSL2 integration is turned on in Docker Desktop as well as your Linux distribution of choice.
  - Some issues may arise from Docker not having access to certain files on your computer. File-sharing can be managed in Docker Desktop under Settings &gt; Resources &gt; File Sharing.
  - Make sure your version of Docker Engine is up to date with the latest release. Docker desktop has convenient updating through the user interface but if you're trouble shooting for a server check out the page on `Docker for Ubuntu Servers` .
- Make sure you have a lab configuration.
  - The easiest way to get a lab directory set up is to run `sparrow create-test-lab` on the command line. This will autogenerate sparrow-configuration files and site-content directories needed for customizing a sparrow instance. After the files are created you can easily edit them to fit your lab's needs.
- Make sure you've downloaded the latest version of sparrow by running:

```text
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/HEAD/get-sparrow.sh)"
```

- Make sure sparrow installed correctly.
  - Run `sparrow info` this shows how the application is installed on your computer.
  - Under `Command-line-interface` it should say `Bundled with PyInstaller: /usr/local/opt/sparrow` .
  - `cd` into `/usr/local/opt/sparrow` and run `ls` to view files within the directory.
  - Ensure that a directory called `srcroot` exists.
- If failing on `backend` container on `sparrow up` , try running `sparrow init` to initialize the database.

Other helpful commands:

- `sparrow up --force-recreate`

When using the bundled version of sparrow I was getting this error

```text
ERROR: for backend  Cannot create container for service backend: invalid mount config for type "bind": bind source path does not exist: /usr/local/opt/sparrow/srcroot/backend
```

This was solved by going into docker desktop and adding `usr/local/opt` to the file-shared list located in settings/Resources/FILE SHARING

Now there is a new issue.. the frontend doesn't start. No error logs, just says `error`.

ERROR: for frontend Cannot start service frontend: OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: process_linux.go:545: container init caused: rootfs_linux.go:76: mounting "/host_mnt/usr/local/opt/sparrow/srcroot/frontend/default-content" to rootfs at "/app/site-content" caused: mkdir /var/lib/docker/overlay2/c87062967c034960a87c9229675f23abdfe4cf76111d5508cce7309fc125f453/merged/app/site-content: operation not permitted: unknown Attaching to srcroot_gateway_1, srcroot_frontend_1, srcroot_api-tests_1, srcroot_backend_1, srcroot_db_1

Looks like the issue is docker is trying to make a directory..?

**docker commit &lt;container_id&gt; my-broken-container && docker run -it my-broken-container /bin/bash**

The above command enters into a container that immediately fails and the saves it's state as a new image and then bashes into that so you can view debug logs

export default DocsPage;
