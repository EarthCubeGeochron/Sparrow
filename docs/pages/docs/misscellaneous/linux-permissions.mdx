Linux Permissions

`ls-la` : Shows permissions on directories

Groups: a group of users

`sudo usermod -a -G groupname username` Add a user to a group

`sudo chown -R username:group .` Change owner to a group to all directories and files in this directory

`sudo pip3 install --update pip` `pip3 install docker-compose`

`sudo apt remove golang-docker-credential-helpers` I don't know what this does. Error with docker credentials

## Creating a new user on Linux server

To create a new user on a Linux server first log into the server and make sure you have sudo privileges. If you do the next command you'll enter is:

```text
## substitute chosen username for <username>
sudo useradd <username>
```

This will create a new user with the chosen username. Next add the password

```text
sudo passwd <username>
```

You will be prompted to enter in a password, and then prompted to re-enter.

Next is to set up a home directory for the user. This is sometimes done automatically but usually not. To create one manually enter:

```text
sudo mkhomedir_helper <username>
```

Next, make sure the user is the owner of that directory by navigating to home and typing `ls -la` . A list of directories and their owners should appear. If there are any groups that the new user should be a part of \(i.e sudo\) you should do this now. You can add users to groups by typing:

```text
sudo usermod -a -G <groupname> <username>
```

Troubleshooting...

If the user logs in but isn't directed to their home directory the problem may be their default shell is wrong. Run `echo $SHELL` to view which shell you are currently in. Check which shells are available by running `which bash` . To change the shell for the user type:

```text
chsh -s <shell> <user>

## for instance
# chsh -s /bin/bash cidzikowski
```

The user will have to log out and then log back in to see changes.
