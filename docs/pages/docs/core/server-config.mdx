Sparrow is configured using **environment variables**.

Configuration variables are most often set in the `sparrow-config.sh` file,
which much be present in the root directory of your Sparrow lab instance. If
available, a `sparrow-config.overrides.sh` and `sparrow-secrets.sh` file will
also be applied, in that order. These "secret" files are designed to contain lab-specific
secret keys, tokens, and other values that should not be added to version control.

Here are a few of the most important variables:

- `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY="very secret string"`: A secret key used for management
  of passwords. Set this in your **LOCAL** environment (it will be copied to
  the Docker runtime as needed). It is the only variable required to run a basic test application.
- The `SPARROW_ENV=<development,production>` environment variable defaults to
  `production`, which disable development-focused features such
  as live code reloading and sourcemaps for performance and security.
- `SPARROW_HTTP_PORT` and `SPARROW_HTTPS_PORT` are used to
  configure the ports on which Sparrow can be accessed. `SPARROW_HTTP_PORT=5002` by default,
  but `SPARROW_HTTP_PORT=80` and `SPARROW_HTTPS_PORT=443` 5002` are typically used to serve
  the application publicly.
- `SPARROW_BACKEND_CONFIG="<path>"`: Location of `.cfg` files containing backend configuration.
  When running in Docker, these values typically do not need to be changed.
- The frontend is configured using the variables `SPARROW_SITE_CONTENT`
  and `SPARROW_BASE_URL`.

## Configuring Sparrow for HTTPS

One of the most important environment variables has to do with running Sparrow
using HTTPS transport security. Most commonly, this is done using Certbot, a
free service that manages certificates. Certbot will automatically create
certificates and update them on a regular basis. To set up Certbot, the
following config values must be set:

- `SPARROW_DOMAIN=<domain>`: The domain name (including optional subdomain) of the Sparrow instance.
  For example, `SPARROW_DOMAIN=wiscar-sparrow.geology.wisc.edu`.
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL=<email>`: The email address associated with the certificate.

If configured, Sparrow will serve SSL on port 443. This can be adjusted with the `SPARROW_HTTPS_PORT`
variable.

:::note
More detailed configurations can be set by directly
using [docker-compose environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/).
