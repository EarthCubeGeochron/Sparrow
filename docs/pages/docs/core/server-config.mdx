Sparrow is configured using **environment variables**.

Configuration variables are most often set in the `sparrow-config.sh` file,
which much be present in the root directory of your Sparrow lab instance. If
available, a `sparrow-config.overrides.sh` and `sparrow-secrets.sh` file will
also be used, in that order. These files "secret" files are designed to contain
secret keys, tokens, and other values that should not be added to version control.

Here are a few of the most important variables:

- `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY="very secret string"`: A secret key used for management
  of passwords. Set this in your **LOCAL** environment (it will be copied to
  the Docker runtime as needed). It is the only variable required to run a basic test application.
- `SPARROW_BACKEND_CONFIG="<path>"`: Location of `.cfg` files containing data.
- The frontend is configured using the variables `SPARROW_SITE_CONTENT`
  and `SPARROW_BASE_URL`.
- The `SPARROW_ENV=<development,production>` environment variable defaults to
  `production`, which disable development-focused features such
  as live code reloading and sourcemaps for performance and security.

## Configuring Sparrow for HTTPS

One of the most important environment variables has to do with running Sparrow
using HTTPS transport security. Most commonly, this is done using Certbot, a
free service that manages certificates. Certbot will automatically create
certificates and update them on a regular basis.  To set up Certbot, the
following config values must be set:

- `SPARROW_DOMAIN=<domain>`: The domain name (including optional subdomain) of the Sparrow instance.
  For example, `SPARROW_DOMAIN=wiscar-sparrow.geology.wisc.edu`.
- `CERTBOT_EMAIL=<email>`: The email address associated with the certificate.

If configured, Sparrow will serve SSL on port 443. This can be adjusted with the `SPARROW_HTTPS_PORT`
variable.

:::note
More detailed configurations can be set by directly
using [docker-compose environment variables](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/).
