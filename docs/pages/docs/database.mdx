# Sparrow Database

Sparrow utilizes a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source
relational database with a large community with resources and documentation.
It can be useful to view and interact with Sparrow using a PostgreSQL client application that has a user interface for interacting and checking tables. Connecting to a local implementation of Sparrow is slightly easier, but a networked version is also possible.

### Local connection

For local development on Mac OS and Windows, these parameters are needed to connect to the database. For Mac OS, [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) has been used to connect. On Windows [DBeaver](https://alternativeto.net/software/dbeaver/about/) has been used to connect locally.

- `Host:` localhost
- `Port:` 54321
- `User:` postgres
- `Database:` sparrow

### Server connection

Depending on the server setup, the following will allow you to login to your remote Sparrow instance and view the database. For a primer on creating SSH keys for servers, take [a look at this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssh-key-based-authentication-on-a-linux-server).

- `Host:` localhost
- `Port:` 54321
- `User:` postgres
- `Database:` sparrow
- `SSH Host:` your-server-url
- `User:` your-server-login
- `Private Key:` SSH-key for your server
