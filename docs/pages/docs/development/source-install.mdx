# Installing Sparrow from source

Using prebuilt versions of Sparrow is the best option in most cases.
However, if you need to modify or propose changes to Sparrow's codebase,
you can set up Sparrow to run directly from a source repository.

:::warning
Installing from source is _no longer required_ to customize Sparrow with data importers and plugins.
The system is designed so that most lab-specific code can be loaded at runtime from the bundled application.
See [Customization]() for more information.

## The core application and frontend

To use a source version of Sparrow's core application code, clone the
[Sparrow](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow) Git repository to your system:
`git clone https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow.git`.
Sparrow has some optional components that are bundled as submodules during development; to install these, use
the `git submodule update --init --recursive` command.

You can point a prebuilt `sparrow` CLI to use this source tree rather than
its own bundled source code by setting the environment
variable `SPARROW_PATH=<your-sparrow-repo-directory>` before running
Sparrow commands.

## The `sparrow` command-line application

To build the Sparrow CLI _itself_ from source,
you must have `python3` (version `>=3.6`) installed on your system.
repository from GitHub into a local directory on your machine. You can build the CLI in several ways:

- `make build`: bundle the application with PyInstaller to a standalone executable
- `make build-dev`: install the application in _editable_ mode for development.
- `make install` and `make install-dev`: build the CLI and install it onto your `PATH`.

`make install-dev` is the most typical operation; it sets the `SPARROW_PATH` to automatically
point to the repository configuration if none is provided in the source environment [see Configuration docs](/docs/config)

By default, the install script writes the application to `/usr/local`.
This path can be modified with the `INSTALL_PATH` and `SPARROW_INSTALL_PATH` environment variables.
