Sparrow tests are run with the `sparrow test` command.

## Options

The testing application has several custom options:

- `--include-slow`: Include slow-running tests.
- `--psql`: Enter a PostgreSQL client application when the tests finish.

Many standard PyTest options can also be used:

- Use the `--pdb` flag to enter a debugger session when a test fails.
- If output is too long, it can be hidden using the `--show-capture=no` flag.
