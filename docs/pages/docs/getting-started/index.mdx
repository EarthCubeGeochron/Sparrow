# Getting started with Sparrow

Sparrow is a complex software application, but it has been packaged for easy
setup on a wide variety of systems, from personal laptops to servers (both
physical and in the cloud). This guide focuses on setting up the system on
personal and workspace computers (i.e., those with and a graphical environment
and attached screens). However, some aspects of server installation are
touched on.

## Install Docker

The first step to running Sparrow is to
[**install the Docker application**](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
using the instructions for your platform.

Sparrow is packaged in a set of [**Docker** containers](https://www.docker.com/).
A container is a miniature
virtual machine designed to hold a single application and all of its
dependencies. Docker enables relatively seamless cross-platform installation of
Sparrow, independent of the configuration of the base system.
The Docker toolchain is stable, open-source, and supported by helpful tools like
[Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] for running applications in development.
Local installation (i.e., without Docker) is straightforward but unsupported at the
moment.

:::note Windows installation
Running Sparrow is easiest on Unix platforms, like **Linux** and **MacOS**.
Running containerized applications on Windows requires some additional steps, although the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux][wsl] has made this considerably easier than in the past.
Please see the [**Sparrow on Windows**](/docs/windows) documentation for more information.
:::

[docker-desktop]: http://docker.com/desktop
[wsl]: https://microsoft.com

<!--
In its containerized form, Sparrow can be installed easily
on any Unix environment. This containerized
distribution strategy will allow easy deployment on any infrastructure
(local, cloud hosting, AWS/Azure, etc.).
-->

Once you have installed Docker, you should be able to access it at the terminal
using the `docker` command. Running a basic example container (e.g., `docker run hello-world`)
is a good idea to make sure that everything is set up properly.

For server installations, it is a good idea to
ensure that your user can run `docker` without root permissions, by running
`sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}` or your distribution's equivalent.
This is automatically set up when using **Docker Desktop**.

## Install the `sparrow` executable

Sparrow's stack of Docker containers are wrapped in a command-line interface
that simplifies management of the system.
Sparrow's command line application is a small Python package that has been
bundled with [PyInstaller][pyinstaller]. New versions of Sparrow are released
periodically on [Github][sparrow-releases]

The `sparrow` CLI is most easily installed using a convenience script that
installs it in the right location based on common configurations. This can be
downloaded and run using the following terminal snippet:

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://sparrow-data.org/get-sparrow.sh)"
```

This command will download Sparrow to your `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/opt` (or `~/.sparrow/opt` on MacOS) directories .
In your favorite terminal or shell, run the command from above. If it is installed properly you should
see the output `Sparrow executable installed!`

:::caution
`get-sparrow.sh` requests **`sudo`** privilege elevation so that it can
install `sparrow` to `/usr/local/bin`, which allows the command to be
run without a path prefix on most systems.
:::

:::note Installation alternatives

- Once you have installed Sparrow, you can easily upgrade to a newer version using the `sparrow update`
  command (added in `v2.1.0`).
- The install prefix can be modified using the `SPARROW_INSTALL_PATH`, `SPARROW_DIST_DIR`, and `INSTALL_PATH` variables.
- If you'd like to install Sparrow manually,
  you can download the setup script and run it locally: `bash get-sparrow.sh`.
- If you'd like to install a specific version of Sparrow, you can add an optional version argument:
  `... get-sparrow.sh -- v2.0.0.beta16`.
- You can always download the executable directly from the [Sparrow releases][sparrow-releases]
  page on GitHub and manually place it on your system's `PATH`.

## Bundled Version

### Shell command

Downloading the bundled version of Sparrow occurs through a `curl` command. `curl` commands are used
to transfer data from servers.

This is the most updated `curl` command at this time. The most recent release can be found at [Sparrow's Github page](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow) in the right most column
under **Releases**. This command will download all the files to your `usr/local/bin` and `usr/local/opt` directories.
In your favorite terminal or shell, run the command from above. If it is installed properly you should
see the output _Sparrow executable installed!_
-->

Once you have installed the `sparrow` CLI, you can try running it in your terminal.

```shell
sparrow
```

The first time it is run, the Sparrow CLI builds Docker containers and sets some basic configuration.
Several errors commonly arise at this step:

- **`command not found`**: Sparrow might not be properly referenced on your command search `PATH`.
- **`Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`** or similar: You may not have started the Docker engine.
- The Docker containers might not build properly, for a variety of reasons.
  If this is the case, follow the [Troubleshooting guide][troubleshooting].

If the Sparrow command-line interface has been installed correctly, it will print some build output, followed
by a list of possible Sparrow commands.

## Set up a Sparrow database and server

An unconfigured instance of Sparrow can be started using the command `sparrow up`.
The environment variable `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY` must be set before running,
but other variables will be set to default values if not provided. Thus, a
minimal working **Sparrow** demo can be run using the following command:

```
SPARROW_SECRET_KEY=TemporaryKey sparrow up
```

This command will spin up several Docker containers including a
database engine, frontend, backend, and gateway service and
automatically run the `sparrow init`
command to set up initial database tables.
The **Sparrow** web interface can then be accessed at `http://localhost:5002`;
the API can be found at `http://localhost:5002/api`.

## Run a configured application

<!-- Or you can continute onto to [creating a new user](/docs/getting-started#creating-a-user) and
[creating a sparrow configuration](/docs/getting-started#running-a-configured-application). -->

In practice, Sparrow needs to be configured differently for each lab that runs
the software. Typically, this is done by creating a lab configuration directory with a
`sparrow-config.sh` file in it. An example of this script
is shown in [`sparrow-config.sh.example`](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/blob/main/sparrow-config.sh.example).
While not _required_ (environment
variables can be set externally), this approach is strongly preferred.

At runtime, the `sparrow` application fsearches
upwards from the current directory until the first file named
`sparrow-config.sh` is found. This behavior is similar to that of the
`git` command.

:::tip
Alternatively, the location of the configuration
file can be set using the `SPARROW_CONFIG` environment variable, allowing
the `sparrow` command to be run from anywhere on the system.
:::

The quickest way to set up an instance of Sparrow is by running

```
sparrow create-test-lab <your-directory>
```

This will create a pre-configured Sparrow instance with a basic configuration file (`sparrow-config.sh`),
a few plugins, and a small test dataset.

<!--

```
git clone https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow.git
cd Sparrow
```
### Installing the command-line interface

**Sparrow** is administered using the `sparrow` command-line
interface. This command wraps application management, database management,
and container-orchestration subcommands (wrapping [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/))
in a single executable, simplifying basic management tasks.
Lab-specific subcommands (e.g. for import scripts) can be included in this
interface.

To install the command-line application, run the setup command within the
`Sparrow` repository directory (you will be asked for a password).

```
make install
```

This will build a development version of the
`sparrow` command-line runner.

### Running Sparrow

Typing `sparrow` at the command line will download and build containers
(this will take a long time on initial run)
and show the [application's help page](/docs/cli).
Seeing the help page successfully means the application has been installed.

-->

## Create a user

On navigating to the web interface for the first time, you will not be logged
in â€” indeed, no user will exist! To create a user, run the `sparrow create-user` command and follow the prompts. There should be a single row in
the `user` table after running this command. Note: the `SPARROW_SECRET_KEY`
environment variable is used to encrypt passwords, so make sure
this value is kept consistent through the lifetime of the application.

:::note
User management will gain capabilities in future versions of **Sparrow**
:::

## Version your lab configuration

Most labs implementing Sparrow manager their configuration and plugins as Git repositories, allowing lab-specific code
to be developed and improved over time.
This also allows lab instances to be made publicly available to guide future implementations.

Several reference implemetations are available:

- [University of Wisconsin Cosmogenic Nuclide lab](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/sparrow-uw-cosmo)
- [Arizona Laserchron Center](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-LaserChron)
- [WiscAr](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-WiscAr)
- [WiscSIMS](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-WiscSIMS)
- [the Desert Research Institute Luminescence Lab (OSL)](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-luminescence-demo)
- [the Boise State isotope geochemistry lab](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-BoiseState-IGL)
- [CU Trail (thermochronology)](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow-CU-TRaIL)

## Inspecting the running application

Several `sparrow` subcommands allow inspection of the running
**Sparrow** application:

- `sparrow test` runs the application's testing suite.
- `sparrow psql` allows interaction with the **Sparrow** database
  using the standard `psql` management tool that ships with PostgreSQL.
- `sparrow db-tunnel` exposes the PostgreSQL database engine
  on `localhost` port `54321` (database `sparrow`, user `postgres`).
  This is useful for schema introspection and data management
  using GUI tools such as [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).
- `sparrow shell` runs an iPython shell within the application.
- `sparrow shell <container>` creates a command-line shell within a Docker
  container in the application.
- `sparrow config` prints the API server configuration.
- `sparrow compose config` prints the `docker-compose` configuration
  in use for running the containerized application.
