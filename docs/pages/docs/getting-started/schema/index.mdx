# Schema

## What is a schema?

A schema is a formal formatted representation of data as defined in
the [Sparrow](https://sparrow-data.org/) database. Schema define the reproducible
structure that is entered into the database and allow for subsequent transformations
of data and connection to other databases.

Sparrow's _import schemas_ interface with its _database schemas_ but are
conceptually separate. Sparrow's import infrastructure allows JSON with an
appropriate schema structure to be imported into the database using the API.

For instance, the _datum schema_ includes the value for one analytical
parameter within one analysis (e.g. <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr),
the name of that type of datum, and uncertainty around the measurement.
Schema such as _session_ include multiple analysis.

## Example schema from Sparrow

The various options for import schema can be viewed through the
_/api-explorer/v2_ route on your implementation of Sparrow. These list the
requirements for data to be incorporated using each nested level of the schema
JSON. When building your importer using schema, be conscientious about what
fields allow for _null_ entries and be sure to exclude _null_ entries.

## Using schema for importing data

Reorganization of data to fit the schema is key. There are many ways to do this, the easiest is likely a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script, although other languages like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) have also been used.

Example code for an R reformater used on data from the [WiscSIMS Lab](http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~wiscsims/) is available in this Github [file](https://github.com/thefallingduck/WiscSIMSDataExtractor/blob/7d6aae690397ac4fe2e9e2b774a80cc6f8a4facd/SparrowReformater.R).

The API has examples of schemas.

There is a command-line feature for seeing schema definitions:
`sparrow show-interface <name-of-interface>`.
This tells you how to assemble the correct JSON to import data.
