### Main Goal

Understand that Sparrow has a lot to offer labs without them building anything of their own. Sparrow is a developed
a complex data infromatics application that allows lab's data to be accessible, shareable, and useable.

## Overview

**_What is a tech stack?_**

A tech stack is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and tools that developers use
to build a web or mobile applcation.

**_What is included in Sparrow's tech stack?_**

Sparrow is made of 3 **MAIN** parts: the **database**, the **Backend**, and the **frontend**. There is a more
in depth description of each further below however the basic technologies they are all based on are as
follows:

- Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- Backend: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Frontend: [React](https://reactjs.org/)

**_Why should you care?_**

Software architecture is very important as each technology has its benefits and limitations. Although,
it may seem more important for developers to understand, as users of the software it's important to understand
the foundations that Sparrow is built upon.

Sparrow's tech stack was chosen with a data center philosophy. The technology utilized by Sparrow is designed
to best fit with the complex relationships that exist in geologic data. These technologies also give Sparrow
a sturdy foundation to grow and improve.

**_What do you get?_**

Lab's that utilize Sparrow will be recieving a complex infromatics system without needing to do any
software development of their own. The only thing lab's need to concern themselves with are data importers.
Sparrow provides a data structure system that allows labs to quickly access, present, and share their data
through the user interface (frontend). Sparrow also provides the ability for labs to customize their own
instance if they so choose.

## Database:

The database is the starting point for Sparrow. This is where a lab's data is housed and where the data is
structured into relational schemas.

The Sparrow databse is built using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Postgres is a database system
focusing on object relationships. The complex relationship structures that arise from geological data are
easily mapped using PostgreSQL. Postgres is free and open source which has developed a giant community of
support and resources around it making it one of they most robust systems available. Postgres is also designed
to work efficiently with [Postgis](https://postgis.net/), a sql based system for dealing with spatially organized
data, making it especially useful for the geosciences.

The developers at Sparrow generally work with the database by proxy through SQL and python queries, however
the databases are directly accessed using third party [PostgreSQL clients](/docs/database) like [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/).

## Backend

The Sparrow backend is the middle man between the database and the frontend. Through the backend data is
transferred. The backend is written in mainly [Python](https://www.python.org/) but utilizes powerful libraries for
different aspects.

Sparrow utilizes the python library [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) for backend - database interactions.
SQLAlchemy allows for database tables and relationships to be mapped to python usable data structures. Using SQLAlchemy abstracts the actual SQL into easier to understand python and it leverages
the ability python has with manipulating data.

The REST API (representational state transfer, application programming interface) is built using
the [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) API framework. The Sparrow API is how data is transfered from the
database to the frontend. The API is accessable on every Sparrow instance and contains extensive documentation
on available routes and filters for data. The API is also how edits and new data is transfered from frontend
interactions to the database.

- GET: Frontend asks the API to query the database.
- PUT/POST: Frontend pushes edits or new data to the API for database insert.

## Frontend

The frontend is the user facing side of the Sparrow application, the lab's website. Sparrow's frontend
is built upon the lab's data in a way that exposes the hierarchical and sometimes complex data structures
that arise.

General data model hierarchy:

- Projects
- Samples (sub-samples)
- Session
- Anaylsis
- Datum

Furthermore, the frontend has evolved to be easier to use and easier to find, edit, or create new data models.
Organizing data is also a main concern of the frontend and a recent feature allows users to add and create [Tags]()
to specific data models.

The Sparrow frontend is also used as documenting platform for data schemas. Components such as the [API-Explorer]()
and the [Schema-Explorer]() are designed to aid labs in understanding the structure their data needs to be in
to import into Sparrow.

The Sparrow frontend is written in TypeScript, a subset of JavaScript, using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library that has become synonymous with frontend development. It makes developing interactive
user interfaces quicker and easier. For labs who wish to create custom frontend plugins, it's highly reccomended
to make them using ReactJS. Another benefit of ReactJS is the ability to share components between projects.
Sparrow utilizes the library [UW-Macrostrat/UI-Components](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/ui-components), a
ReactJS component library made by the same developers of Sparrow. Sharing components cuts down on the amount of
work and creates a developer community.
