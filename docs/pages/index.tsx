        <b>Sparrow</b> allows labs to organize analytical data and track
        project- and sample-level metadata. Its metadata management interface
        streamlines tasks such as controlling embargo, identifying and linking
        geologic and publication metadata, and generating aggregate summaries.

        <b>Sparrow</b> straightforwardly implements FAIR (findable, accessible,
        interoperable, reusable) data-management principles atop current data
        archives and lab analytical processes. It provides a standard API access
        layer for geochemical data produced by individual geochronology
        laboratories, which allows data to be extracted by end users and
        centralized archives.

        <b>Sparrow</b>'s web interface enables aggregate summaries of
        geochemical data and metadata, driven by your data archive to convey the
        scope and impact of your lab's work. Useful summaries, such as a{" "}
        <a href="sparrow.boisestate.edu">map view of sample locations</a>, are
        bundled by default.

        All parts of <b>Sparrow</b> can be customized. Common
        metadata-management functionality comes out of the box, but it can be
        augmented for lab-specific needs. <b>Sparrow</b> is open-source software
        that is built to be lightweight, flexible, and standards-compliant. It's
        like <a href="https://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> for geochemical data!
