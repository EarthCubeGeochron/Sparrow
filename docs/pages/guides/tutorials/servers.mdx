# Servers

One sticking point to running your own instance of Sparrow is working on a Linux server.
Here we have compiled tips for working on Linux.

## Permissions

Linux has the concept of "users" and "groups". Files can be scoped for access (read, write, and/or execute) by either
user or group.

When multiple users are working on a machine and changing files, it is easy for permissions to get out of sync.

    $ sudo chown -R username:group /path/to/folder

## Github authorization

Personal access tokens or SSH keys are required to push to GitHub. These can often be hard to set up.
The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) can help you set up these integrations.
The [Linux installation instructions](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md)
can be tough to find.
