# Developing the Sparrow documentation website

## Developing locally

- In the `docs` folder in the Sparrow codebase, run `npm run dev` to test the Next.js site.
- You can run `make` or `make build` to build a Docker container.
- Merging changes to `main` in Sparrow's GitHub repository will trigger builds of the documentation site.
