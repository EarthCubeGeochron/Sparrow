## Motivation

Best practices for data accessibility and archiving are a key concern
within the geochronology community. However, many efforts to standardize
processes have seen limited community uptake due to the extra work
entailed in uploading data into centralized repositories.
Meanwhile, evolving time-integrated digital Earth
models must be referenced against robust, global age datasets compiled
from geochronology data in geologic context.

We attempt to solve two problems at once: first, we want to make it
easier for labs to manage their data by allowing them to control
their own data system. Second, we want to allow these data systems to
be accessible, so data can be aggregated from multiple labs. Ultimately,
we hope to automate the annoying process of data archiving.

## Implementations

An early beta version of **Sparrow** has been implemented in several labs. Large
portions of the analytical archive of each lab have been ingested, and work is
progressing on building metadata management functionality.

## Support

**Sparrow** is supported by the NSF EarthCube program under grant [EAR-1740694](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740694),
_Geochronology Frontier at the Laboratory-Cyberinformatics Interface_.

## Why _Sparrow_?

It's not an acronym – the name _Sparrow_ is meant to evoke the spirit of this
tool: sparrows are small, familiar birds that come in many different types. They
blend easily into human environments.

**Sparrow** is designed for light weight and ease of management, and embraces
diversity — it gives labs control of data and process, within a common framework.
Like the bird, each lab's version of **Sparrow** will look similar to outsiders
but have unique characteristics adapted to its situation.
