We're going to have a virtual workshop covering **Sparrow** just before GSA 2020!
The EarthCube workshop "Geochronology Frontier at the Laboratory-Cyberinformatics
Interface" will run October 21-23, 2020 and cover design, usage, and
implementation of the Sparrow laboratory information management system in
geochronology and geochemistry labs.

Check out [**the full circular**](https://sparrow-data.org/media/2020/oct-2020-workshop-circular.html) and express interest via [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_oYaGJdafpIx9F8wd05RBiXOR_EVOgYyRg4p5F7kZzRLaPg/viewform). Can't wait to
see people there!
