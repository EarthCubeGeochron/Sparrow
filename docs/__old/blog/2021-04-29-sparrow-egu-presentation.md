**Sparrow** will be featured in this week's virtual European Geosciences Union session,
[*Managing Geochemical Data from Field to Lab to Publication to Archive*](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/40315). Our contribution, [*Implementing the Sparrow laboratory data system in multiple subdomains of geochronology and geochemistry*](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-13832),
will showcase efforts to implement a common data overlay on the archives of labs specializing in fields
including thermochronology, radiocarbon/AMS, detrital zircon U-Pb, cosmogenic nuclides, and SIMS.

We are also participating in a contribution
[*Linking data systems into a collaborative pipeline for geochemical data from field to archive*](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/session/40315)
led by Kirsten Lehnert of LDEO and EarthChem, which envisions Sparrow as a potential
contributor to an interoperable set of data systems spanning the entire lifecycle
of geoscience sample data.
