The `sparrow` command-line application has a *locally installed* mode
and a *bundled* mode. Most users should be using the bundled application
unless they are actively developing with Sparrow.

Both versions can be built and installed from the Sparrow source directory.

Build and install the local version: `make install-dev`
Build and install the development version: `make install`
