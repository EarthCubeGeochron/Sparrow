**Sparrow** is administered using the `sparrow` command-line
interface. This command wraps application management,
database management, and `docker-compose` orchestration subcommands in a
single executable, simplifying basic management tasks.

## Container orchestration

Sparrow bundles its own version of [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
for container orchestration. All commands that are part of the compose interface
can be used to access and manage containers that are part of a
Sparrow installation.

Some key commands:

- `sparrow compose config`: print out the entire Docker-compose configuration
