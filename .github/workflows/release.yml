            The latest release of Sparrow can be installed using the following command:
            ```
            bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/HEAD/get-sparrow.sh)"
            ```

            - If you want to install this release specifically, you can add it to the above command,
              like so: `bash -c $(...) - ${{ github.ref }}`.
            - You can also download the installation
              script manually and run it using `bash get-sparrow.sh` or `bash get-sparrow.sh $${{ github.ref }}`.
            - For complete control over the installation process, you can manually run the download and installation steps
              encapsulated by the [install script](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/blob/HEAD/get-sparrow.sh).

            See the [Getting started documentation](https://sparrow-data.org/docs/getting-started).
