## TODO: way to delete publications from this route
# maybe have an actions field for query, one would be delete, if that was there it would call a function
# that handles removing that relationship from project.
# PROBLEM: This solution won't remove the publication completely, as it shouldn't in a real world senario.
# it just removes the foreign id reference. We'll have to just remove them with a quick algorithim or something
