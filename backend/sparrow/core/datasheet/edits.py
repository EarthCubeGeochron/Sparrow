    This will be the end route for the database editing.

    The way to do this is be able to load the Sample table as a Sqlalchemy
    class object and run update() on it.

    Use the automap_base() to create classes we can do sessions on
    https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/extensions/automap.html

    And then edit a class object directly by changing a specific value like here
    https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/tutorial.html#adding-and-updating-objects

    db.model: list of automap_base models
    setattr(): a python function that will allow us to edit the automapped object
        setattr(model_name, edit_field, new_value) where edit_field is a string and model_name is the query object

    Recieved request data should be only the changes and the id.

    ## TODO: Handle an incoming Project and Publcation Change, That is a DIFFERENT TABLE.
    ## The issue is, we need to add some foriegn keys to the project and sample...
    ## add the project to the project_sample table and then publication to the project_pub table
    ## For NOW: fix by associating pub with the project that the sample is associated with..
    ## If there are more than one publications leave it uneditable and have a button that goes
    # to sample the project page
    ## Try to create a relationship between the session and project and publication maybe

    db = app_context().database  ## This gives me access to the Database class

    ## get the data from the post request and turn it into a dict.
    request_data = await request.json()

    ## for some reason this wasn't working with real request, only for tests...
    # request_dict = json.loads(request_data)

    ## grab the sample table from automap_base
    table = db.model.sample

    ## function to make sure material passed is in vocab_material, if not add it.
    material_check(db, request_data)

    ## Call my make_changes function
    make_changes(table, request_data, db.session)
