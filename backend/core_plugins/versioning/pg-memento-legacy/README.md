# Legacy PGMemento extensions

In Sparrow versions < 4.0.0, the PGMemento extension was implemented within
the Sparrow application as a plugin. Newer versions build PGMemento as an
extension. We keep old scripts (from https://github.com/pgMemento/pgMemento/commit/33c98951f04b3a03d8fd97ba7311d68e23ae3e66) here to power schema migrations.
