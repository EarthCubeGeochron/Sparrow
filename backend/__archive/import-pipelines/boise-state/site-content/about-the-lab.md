## About the lab

The Boise State University Isotope Geology Laboratory (IGL) is a
state-of-the-art facility for the analysis of radiogenic isotopes in Earth
materials, with a focus on in situ and high-precision geochronology (U-Pb
zircon) and tracer isotope geochemistry. These tools can be applied to a variety
of problems in igneous and metamorphic petrology, structural geology and
tectonics, paleobiological evolution and paleoclimate change in deep time.
See our [**main website**](https://earth.boisestate.edu/isotope/) for
further details.

## Geochronology data system

The IGL is a node in the [EARTHTIME Network](http://www.earth-time.org/)
for the Calibration of Earth History. It is also a partner in the
NSF EarthCube Geochronology Infrastructure project. This
[**Sparrow**](https://sparrow-data.org) lab information management system
is a product of that collaboration.
