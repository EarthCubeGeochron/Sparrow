## About the lab

Welcome to the default implementation of
[**Sparrow**](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow)!


## A container for your lab's data

**Sparrow** holds a lab's data archive and makes it accessible via this web interface
and [a standard API](/api-explorer). Right now, this is
an empty container, but you can shortly begin populating the
system with your data by creating an
[import pipeline](https://github.com/EarthCubeGeochron/Sparrow/tree/master/import-pipelines)!
